## Scenario 
A large e-commerce company is experiencing frequent outages and slow performance of its online platform,
resulting in customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue. The company's development and operations teams are working in
silos, with limited communication and collaboration. There is a lack of visibility into system health and performance,
making it challenging to identify and resolve issues promptly.

## Application of DevOps Principles and Practices:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implementing CI/CD practices can help address the challenges
faced by the e-commerce company. By adopting automated testing and continuous delivery pipelines, the team can catch and
fix issues earlier in the development process. This ensures that stable and reliable updates are deployed to production
environments frequently, reducing the risk of outages and improving overall system performance.

Monitor the Right Metrics: Establishing a comprehensive monitoring system to track key metrics such as response time,
error rates, and resource utilization is crucial. By monitoring these metrics in real-time, the team can proactively
identify performance bottlenecks and potential issues. This enables them to take immediate action, optimize system
performance, and minimize downtime.

Implement Automation: Automation plays a vital role in managing the infrastructure and configuration of the e-commerce
platform. By utilizing infrastructure-as-code tools and configuration management, the team can automate the provisioning
and deployment of resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. Automated scaling mechanisms can also be
implemented to handle increased traffic during peak periods, maintaining optimal system performance.
